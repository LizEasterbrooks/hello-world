# hello-world
A beginner's repository

Hi, I'm Liz. This is my first time messing around with GitHub. The concept behind the service is so wonderful, I wish I could
apply to any and all of my creative work processes :)

Since GitHub's tutorial asked suggested we name the repository "Hello World" I guess I can add some examples of hello world in the few
programming languages I know. (Imma skip MASM if that's alright with everyone ;3).

I wrote the seed of the actualCode file in C, so how about C++ first.
